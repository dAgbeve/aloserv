# aloserv
This is a mini server born out of the philosophy of learning by practice. To fully understand networking in the unix environment with a focus on TCP/IP stack i decided to code this server using multi-threading approach with thread-specific data implementation.

An object oriented approach was taken to cement my knowledge of the C language.

The server is hosting my personal website at www.agbeve.com.
